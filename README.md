# Simple-C-Hangman

Quick game where a player has 5 lives and they must guess a randomly selected
10 char word from a list.

Future Changes/Additions:
    - Using different word lengths 
    - Using a library of all different english words and choosing from there
    - Include a visual of the actual hangman game, where lines are drawn
      after each round
